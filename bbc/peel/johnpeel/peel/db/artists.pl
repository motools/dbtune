Their rather macabre name is taken from a Mayan ritual chant, rather than a penchant for serial killing, which must be a relief to their record company.<BR/>Founder members Jason Reece and Conrad Keely, who between them sing and play drums and guitar, first met in Hawaii. They moved to the college town of Olympia, Washington in 1993, to take advantage of the town\'s thriving music scene. Both joined various bands, but tired of the north west and moved to Austin, Texas, home of the South by South West festival, and started playing as a duo under the name You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead. Bass player Neil Busch and guitarist Kevin Allen joined soon after and the band name expanded to include ... And. In 1998 they put out a cassette of a live show on local indie Golden Hour Records, which was followed by a self-titled album on Trance Syndicate. ... Trail of Dead moved to Merge records to release 2001\'s \'Madonna\'. They were picked up by Interscope and put out the albums \'Source Tags and Codes\' (2002) and \'World\'s Apart\' (2005) to much critical acclaim.<BR/>Despite their major label funding the band remain true to their roots and are happy for fans to tape their shows as long as they receive a copy of the recording.<BR/><blockquote>"...Trail of Dead was great because they were thrilled to be there and so impressed at everything we said - \'Wow, you worked with that guy?\' or \'I didn\'t know so-and-so had played here!\'.<BR/>They kept the excitement up during the gig by playing pre-recorded fillers in-between songs, and the audience loved it."</blockquote>']).

They were one of several Welsh bands who, following the success of Manic Street Preachers, began to clamour for their own space in the music press and record shops of Britain. Whilst never as popular as their contemporaries such as Stereophonics and The Super Furry Animals, the Dolls had a devoted, and T-shirted, fanbase.The band formed in the mostly working class city of Newport in Wales. Richard Parfitt (vocals/ guitar) and Mike Cole (bass) met whilst signing on and discovered a shared interest in Motown and classic British rock bands such as The Jam, The Clash and The Who. Six months later, in 1993, they were joined by drummer Carl Bevan.<BR/>Having built up a reputation for rowdy and energetic performances around Wales, they were signed to Indolent Records and released their first single \'Happy Shopper\' in 1994. Singles \'Pig Valentine\' and Stay\' followed and in 1995 they joined the NME Brat Bus tour alongside Veruca Salt and Marion. Album \'The Big Three\' was released in 1996 and its follow-up \'Joya Magica\' appeared in 1998. The band split in 1999 after being dropped by Indolent.']).

Billy\'s lyrics are sometimes cutting and angry, sometimes warm, but always insightful and witty. His songs paint a picture of Britain in the 1980s and capture the disillusionment that many felt at the time. <BR/> He was born in Barking, London as Stephen William Bragg and started playing guitar in his teens with his next-door neighbour Wiggy. The two of them formed a punk band called Riff Raff, but success was not forthcoming.<BR/>Surprisingly, Billy then joined the army. Unsurprisingly he hated it and bought his way out with �175 and returned to his parents\' home. <BR/> Billy devised ingenious strategies to get his demo tapes heard. He pretended to be a television repair man in order to get into the office of Peter Jenner at Charisma Records. When Billy heard our own John Peel announce he was hungry on air, he rushed to the BBC studios with a mushroom biriyani and a tape. He was rewarded with lots of airplay, which John always insisted he would have got anyway. <BR/> In 1985, the year after he released \'Brewing Up With Billy Bragg\', he helped to form the left-wing youth movement Red Wedge, whose members also included Paul Weller and Jimmy Sommerville. 1984 also saw one of Billy\'s songs, \'New England\' become a Top 10 hit, albeit sung by Kirsty MacColl. Album after album followed, but it was 1991\'s \'Don\'t Try This At Home\' which featured his biggest hit, \'Sexuality\'. Billy took several years off to concentrate on fatherhood and his most recent album is 2002\'s \'England, Half English\'. Wiggy still plays in his backing band. <BR/><blockquote>"I was coming back from a gig somewhere and my girlfriend met me at the station and told me that the BBC phoned wanting me to do a Peel session. So I thought this was it - I\'m a made man! I\'m in! I rang my record company and said \'How am I going to get there? I don\'t even know where Maida Vale is. How am I going to get all my stuff on the tube?\' And they said \'Bill, they pay you to do this, get a bloody taxi\', which I thought was too good to be true; they PAY you to do a Peel session!"</blockquote><BR/>Billy Bragg']).

The media went Bis mad and the group signed to Wiija in the UK and the Beastie Boys\' Grand Royal in the States.

After becoming perhaps the most successful band of the Britpop era, Blur began to crack up. Damon split from his long-term girlfriend, Elastica singer Justine Frischman, Dave stopped drinking and gained a pilot\'s licence, Alex holed up in various London bars with new friends Damien Hirst and Keith Allen, and Graham, sickened by it all, left the group. Blur continued as a three piece. Now their future is uncertain. Damon has said he no longer wants to record without Graham, but his former guitarist has, so far, remained silent.<BR/><blockquote>"I don\'t know why, but John got this thing in his mind that he wanted to invite artists round to his house to do sessions, rather than at Maida Vale all the time.

As reggae\'s best known artist, his music is responsible for spreading the messages of the Rastafarian faith and stories of the Jamaican people. <BR/>Born Robert Nesta Marley in Jamaica in1945, Bob moved to the island\'s capital Kingston at the age of 14 to become a pupil of local singer Joe Higgs. He went on to form a group called The Teenagers, who later changed their name to The Wailing Rude Boys, later The Wailers. This version of the group disbanded in 1966, but later reformed with Marley (lead vocals), Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston. This line up released \'Catch A Fire\' (1973) and \'Burnin\' (1974), before Tosh and Livingston left to pursue solo careers. Marley then started working with the I-Threes, consisting of his wife Rita, Marcia Griffith and Judy Mowatt. Together they produced 1975\'s \'Natty Dread\' which contained the worldwide hit \'No Woman No Cry.\' <BR/>An assassination attempt in 1976 meant he was forced to leave Jamaica and settle in America. The album \'Exodus\', considered a classic, was released in 1977. But in 1980 Marley collapsed whilst jogging in new York\'s Central Park. He was found to have cancer, which had spread through his lungs, liver and brain. He died on May 11, 1981, aged just 36. <BR/><blockquote>"When Marley arrived at the studio, you realised he was a star; very quiet and somehow dignified. Of course, all of them were there then, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh. <BR/>"I seem to remember it took a lot of time to get it started, there was a lot of sitting around, as you\'d expect, and, at that time, of course, possessing marijuana was an imprisonable offence; they did everything very discreetly, but you could smell it, even through the double doors, in the control room. They were also grinding hash up and putting it in honey. What was I supposed to do? BBC training would probably have told me to call the police. <BR/>"Anyway, that was on their first visit to Britain, years before they were noticed. Only Island and us were on to them then." </blockquote><BR/>- John Walters (In Session Tonight by Ken Garner)']).

The Datsuns all took the name of the band as a last name, but whether they wanted to be a Ramones-esque band of brothers, or just to avoid the taxman is unclear. Nonetheless the slinky-hipped vocalist Dolph Datsun and his cohorts took Britain by storm, with support from John Peel and huge amounts of hype from the UK press. They started their tour sleeping on sofas and ended it with various record companies fighting to foot their hotel bills. The Datsuns signed to V2 in 2002 and released their self-titled debut album. They followed it with \'Outta Sight, Outta Mind\' in 2004. <BR/><blockquote>"They were just incredible. They were all over the place - playing upstairs, hanging off the balcony, jumping on top of speakers, jumping on top of the Hammond organ we\'d set up. Plenty of guitar solos with their heads right back, the works. And it didn\'t matter that it was for a session. There\'s not many bands that put that much effort into a performance. Afterwards they were collapsed on the floor, completely knackered, because everything was focused on that hour performance, like how a footballer trains all week for those 90 minutes on the pitch on Saturday. Absolutely stunning."</blockquote><BR/>- Simon Askew']).

He was swept along by acid house and in 1989 released a re-work of The Eurhythmics\' \'Sweet Dreams\', called the \'Nightmare Mix\', which reached No. 23 in the UK charts.

In 1996 he released \'Archive No.1\' which was critically praised for breaking away from the straightjacket of techno purism. Even after many years of the music business, Dave hasn\'t lost his enthusiasm: \'I have an unbridled passion for this,\' he says. \'I suppose I\'ve never grown up. I hope so.\' <BR/>\'He\'s quite a techie person, so we\'d spend a while chatting about the equipment in the studio. Then the next time we\'d see him he\'d say that he\'d bought all the stuff he\'d been talking about before. <BR/>He is also part of the sessions family because he\'s done so many and John really loved him. When we did John\'s tribute night Dave was one of the first people to come forward to perform, and he ended up playing a beautiful set, mixing Teenage Kicks into techno.

He has been David Jones, Ziggy Stardust, The Thin White Duke and The Man Who Fell To Earth. <BR/>He started out in south London, changing his last name from Jones to Bowie when The Monkees\' Davy Jones became a star. He released a few unsuccessful mod-style singles, before recreating himself as a singer/songwriter for his first album \'Man Of Words, Man Of Music\'. He followed this with the rockier \'The Man Who Sold The World\' and the avant-pop of \'Hunky Dory\'. <BR/>But Bowie\'s global breakthrough came when he unveiled Ziggy Stardust, his bisexual glam-alien character. The albums \'Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars\' and \'Aladdin Sane\' followed. After retiring Ziggy, Bowie began to move in a direction he called plastic soul for \'Young Americans\' and \'Station To Station\'. However his heavy cocaine usage was starting to take its toll. He moved to Berlin in an effort to clean up and started to collaborate with Brian Eno, producing 1977\'s \'Low\', following it up with the classic \'Heroes\'. Later albums were less well received. Although David Bowie remains an interesting an experimental artist, his career in recent years has lost a little of the sheen that made him such a glorious spectacle at his peak.']).

With three singles (\'Line Up\', \'Connection\' and \'Waking Up\') making it into the Top 20, \'Elastica\' was seen as a defining record of the Britpop era - perhaps too much so, since they seemed incapable of recording a follow-up.

This was followed by \'79\'s \'Replicas\', which included the smash hit single \'Are Friends Electric?\', an influential Peel Session, and, later that same year, \'The Pleasure Principle\', which spawned \'Cars\'. \'Cars\' sealed Numan\'s fame both here and in the US, backed up by elaborate, futuristic stage shows. More albums followed - \'Telekon\' (1980), \'The Dance\' (1981), \'I, Assasain\' (1982), \'Warriors\' (1983) - but sales were declining, and \'Warriors\' was to spawn his last top ten hit. ']).

Spurred on by Martin Rossiter\'s witty and sometimes outrageous interviews, by January 1995 the band had been named \'Best New Act\' at NME\'s Brat Awards. Their debut album \'Olympian\' reached the Top 10 in 1995. It was followed by a collection of b-sides and Peel sessions in 1996, and another album, \'Drawn to the Deep End\', in 1997. Despite reaching the Top 10, \'Drawn Into the Deep End\' received mixed reviews, and by 2000, the band found themselves without a record deal.

By the beginning of 1992, \'Smells Like Teen Spirit\' had hit the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic and \'Nevermind\' had toppled Michael Jackson\'s \'Dangerous\' from the top of the US album chart. However, cracks started to appear at the peak of the band\'s success. Shortly after the release of the final Nirvana album, \'In Utero\', the band\'s troubled frontman Kurt Cobain went through a series of heroin overdoses, and eventually committed suicide on April 4th 2004. John Peel spotted Nirvana early - the band recorded three Peel Sessions in 1989, 1990 and 1991. <BR/><blockquote>"Nirvana did a few sessions at Maida Vale. I think I did their last one, which was still relatively early in their career. Jeff Smith phoned me and said \'you\'ve got a really hot one this week - Nirvana\', and to be honest I hadn\'t really heard of them. The session went well, and I thought they were good. We recorded it, went to the pub for a couple of drinks, then came back to mix it. It was only when their manager, John Silva, came in to the studio and told them that they\'d just gone double-platinum in America (with \'Nevermind\') that I thought, \'hmm, they must be quite famous then\'.<BR/>"I remember that Kurt didn\'t react much when his manager told him their album was number one in the States. He seemed to be more bothered about that fact that Fender had delivered six white, left-handed Stratocaster guitars to his hotel room. They must\'ve liked the session though, because they later insisted that I do the live recording at Reading. The Foo Fighters have used me ever since, too."</blockquote><BR/>John Peel']).

They were progressive, wilfully intense, and though most famous members Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore are both over 50, their last album, 2004\'s \'Sonic Nurse\', was their most difficult in ages. Architects of grunge, guaranteed to challenge.  ']).

Morrissey\'s enigmatic persona, with his self-confessed celibacy, militant vegetarianism and obsession with forgotten 1960s movie stars, launched a thousand clones. Johnny Marr\'s effortless knack for a melody melded perfectly with his partner\'s grimly witty observations on life and death. Supported by bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, The Smiths reeled off countless hits like \'This Charming Man\', \'Heaven Knows I\'m Miserable Now\', \'Panic\' and \'Ask\'. The band flourished with landmark Peel sessions that were, for many, their first introduction to The Smiths and were compiled on the superb \'Hatful Of Hollow\' album. The band were about to sign to EMI after four excellent albums, but suddenly split in 1987 amid much acrimony. With Morrissey\'s current \'superstar\' solo career, a reunion currently seems unlikely.<BR/><blockquote>"When we first got the call do to our initial session we were in our manager\'s office in Manchester, which was a clothing manufacturing warehouse where we rehearsed. Joe, our manager, told us we\'d got a Peel session and we were ecstatic and then we immediately panicked because we\'d not really had any experience of being in a studio.<BR/>"On the day of the session we set off from Manchester, all of us in a little van, at about 7am, so by the time we got to London we were pretty exhausted. As an eighteen year old I felt so intimidated walking into the BBC. <BR/>"Those sessions taught me how to make records. We had to do it very quickly, so we had to be really together and know what we were doing. We worked very hard, and it was worth it.<BR/>"Shortly afterwards, after our first album came out, we realised that some of the versions of the songs on the album weren\'t as good as the way we did them on the John Peel session. Because of this we put out a compilation called \'Hatful Of Hollow\', which featured those John Peel sessions, and as a result they pretty much became the definitive versions of the songs we recorded for John. <BR/>"What happened to us was that whenever a session came up, we wrote songs, because we needed them, especially for the session. \'This Charming Man\', for example, was written because we had a John Peel session and we didn\'t have enough songs. The session was on a Friday, and on the Tuesday I just got out of bed and wrote this tune because we needed another song for the session."</blockquote><BR/>- Johnny Marr, The Smiths']).

Sir Henry\'s philosophy was, "If I had all the money I\'d spent on drink I\'d spend it all on drink." <BR/> When Peel went on holidays he asked Vivian to stand in for him. Vivian launched his alter-ego character, Sir Henry on Peel\'s Top Gear show and it was so successful with listeners that he was asked to continue the skit when Peel returned from holidays. <BR/> <blockquote>John said of Vivian: "I could never really think of anything to say when I\'d played one of his pieces on the radio, and would end up, rather feebly, with something along the lines of \'I fear that a single one of Viv\'s thoughts would blow my damn brains out.\'"</blockquote>']).

From screeching art-rock and jangling pop songs to electronic soundscapes and hushed lullabies, Yo La Tengo push the musical barrier further than any other band. <BR/> John Peel spotted their genius early and got them playing a Peel Session that went down as one of the all time greatest live recordings the band has ever made. <BR/> The name "Yo La Tengo," when translated into Spanish means "extra mayo, please."
